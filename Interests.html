    <img src="Rose Watercolor.jpg"> </img>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Watercoloring is one of my favorite things to do. this is an original painting that I created for my step-father, during his birthday.</p>
  <h2>Lucius my Puppy</h2>
  <br>
    <img src= "Lucius.jpg"> 
 <P style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Most of my time is spent walking, chasing and playing with this guy. He keeps me quite busy. He loves attention, and will force your hand on his head, so that he can be petted. </P>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">He's really good at sit and shake. He will also go to his kennel when asked, which he can escape by unlocking the latches.</p>
